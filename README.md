GLF Mini
---

GLF (*G*rammatical *L*ogical *F*ramework) is a framework for developing natural-language semantics systems.
It combines the [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) and [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io/doc/)
to support the full pipeline from natural-language parsing to semantics construction and logic development.

*GLF Mini* is intended as a small GLF version that can be used in a Jupyter kernel.

You can find a GLF demo [here](https://gl.kwarc.info/COMMA/glf-demo-lfmtp2019)
and a paper about GLF [here](https://kwarc.info/people/mkohlhase/submit/lfmtp-19.pdf).
