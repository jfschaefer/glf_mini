GFL Mini
---

GFL (*G*rammatical *L*ogical *F*ramework) is a framework for developing natural-language semantics systems.
It combines the [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) and [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io/doc/)
to support the full pipeline from natural-language parsing to semantics construction and logic development.

We are in the process of developing an unified interface the creation of a natural-language semantics system.
*GFL Mini* is intended as an easy-to-setup version that doesn't require setting up MMT and connecting to it.


Prerequisites
===

You need to have the [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) installed and `gf`
needs to be in your path.

Note that GFL Mini has only been tested on UNIX systems.
